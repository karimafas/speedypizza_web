# Speedy Pizza Web


## Introduction

Speedy Pizza is a restaurant and pizzeria located in Florence, Italy – therefore, the interface of this app is in Italian, but I wrote out all documentation in English. Since 1997, the restaurant has relied on a strong, Java-powered PC application to handle food deliveries.

I was hired by Speedy Pizza to recreate their software in a more modern and robust way, with a few adjustments and changes. The client needed an app that was similar to what they already had in use, in order to minimise staff re-training. They needed something that could:
  • Hold a record of all customers who called in for delivery
  • Create orders based on their menu and variations
  • Print a ticket for the kitchen, and one to send with the customer's physical order
  • Review all orders, edit them, re-print them
