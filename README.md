# Speedy Pizza Web


## Introduction

Speedy Pizza is a restaurant and pizzeria located in Florence, Italy. Since 1997, the restaurant has relied on a strong, Java-powered PC application to handle food deliveries. I was hired by Speedy Pizza to recreate their software in a more modern and robust way, with a few adjustments and changes. The client needed an app that was similar to what they already had in use, in order to minimise staff re-training.
