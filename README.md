# Speedy Pizza Web

## Introduction

Speedy Pizza is a restaurant based in Florence, Italy. Since 1997, the restaurant has relied on a strong, Java-powered PC application to handle food deliveries. I was hired by Speedy Pizza to recreate their software in a more modern and robust way, with a few adjustments and changes. The client needed an app that was similar to what they already had in use, in order to minimise staff re-training. 

## Built with
* Flutter
* Firebase Firestore
* Animated and Responsive Interface
* [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider)

## Preview
I have deployed an up-to-date version of this project. It's available [here](https://speedypizzaweb.web.app).
  
## Features
* **Home**: where the ordering process starts. The customer's phone number is the key to access the next steps.
* **Customer Details**: details are pulled from the database, and can be edited from this screen.
* **Order**: you can add items and variations to the order by their unique product number, or by clicking on the listview. 
* **Review and Print**: duplicate, delete or edit your items, choose a delivery time and print your order.
* **Archive**: see all past orders, delete, edit or re-print them.
* **Speedy Pony**: assign a rider to each order, and pay riders fairly at the end of the shift.
